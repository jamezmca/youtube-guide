 value proposition

thumbnail intrigue
give example in picture


target audience
wants values fears insecurities


titles for education
- short (brackets for more context)
- if it's a faq, then phrase it how it would be googled (probably already knows why they need to know, so more about how i know)
- if it's a saq, then phrase it hypey (and need to tell person why they need to know)
- casing should match the style (professional has correct casing)
- emphasis on one keyword with all caps


hook and video context (meet/satisfy user expectation/deliver on promise) in first 3-8 seconds
    - first couple of seconds you hook, meet the expectation and set a foreshadow
    - could also be visual consistency between thumbnail and intro
then what how & why (why they should care) -> hit user stats
then why they should watch your video (who you are, intro, what you offer, why they should trust you, what they'll get by the end of the video, tables of contents, highlights, ) -> further hit user stats

types of hooks
    - what's the problem i'm trying to solve with the video?
    - resonate with the painpoint & my experience them (if you're struggling in javascript, dont worry, i've got you! take a deep breath and sit back as I teach you everything you need to know about javascript. I remember when I was first learning javascript for the first time, I would sometimes spend days on end just trying on understand one singular concept or answering a simple question; it felt pretty overwhelming at times but i don't want to it feel like that for you. In this video i'm going to teach )
        - people want to learn javascript but it's hard and they want a resource they can trust to make them competent
        - i establish credibility
        - I've shared the coders experience
        - 
    - pose a question the viewers want to know an answer too (relatable or curious for eg) (question)
    - drop them in the most exciting part (hook)
    - shock or surprise them (statement)
    - plus visual hook

Statement, what I'll be sharing, why I wanted to share and how I'll do it

Ad formula
- Problem: Do you struggle with isolation as a gamer?
- Problem agitation: the smarter you are, the harder it is
- Solution: [Somehow these stickers solve the problem]
- Outcomes: [benefits of having the sitckers]
- Social proof: [I doubt you have this yet, so can skip]
- CTA: [Some simple call to action]

SCRIPT WRITING 101 for education (maybe not so much storytelling/viral)

BENS 
-> for education not so much viral stuff & story telling (BIG EASY NEW SAFE - perhaps not for viral)
-> even for thumbnails and titles
-> safe (i've done it)

SETUP
    - 1 to 3 things
    - if your thumbnail and title don't create 3 big questions, probs not big enough
    - list as many questions thumbnail and title create, order them by importance, and you have to pay them off
    - intro script after hook needs to address these 3 or so major questions

LOOP - pose an interesting question
    - perhaps one of the other questions people might have
    - throw it in the way of the true content and talk about it first

POINT 1 2 & 3
    - pay off what you setup
    - rehook at the start of each point
    - wait till the end to deliver the point, and speak all about it first
    - use stories before the payoff

HOOK & SETUP - onto next video

then get them to 5/6 minutes then they'll stay (pot commited)

constant baiting (curiousity loop / subplot -> viewers wants to close the curiosity gap, but first)

- number of steps
- explain something exciting, but first we need to do this
- which we'll touch on later in the video
- by the end of the video
- hook, foreshadow, story tell up to climax later in the video (which is the true complete delivery of content)
- reminders
- visual maps


story telling -> live the thoughts dreams desire goals fears

show don't tell


educational -> whats my experience, what credibility do i have, what is the viewer going to take away from the video

story telling -> establish the stakes quickly

search based videos
foundational videos

then into personality videos



THE STORY TELLING CYCLE

starts on the side -> ordinary world and goes through special world

1. status quo (introduce main character)
2. call to adventure (why you're doing this video & whats to come)
3. assistance (add source of knowledge)
4. **SPECIAL WORLD** departure (step into unknown, start the challenge or whatever your video is about)
5. trial (barriers that separate you on your way to the videos main goal | add some spice and action)
6. approach (might show a teaser of the biggest threat)
7. crisis (darkest point of the story, character faces the biggest challenge, gets defeated so badly but then finds something)
8. treasure (new idea, motivation, support from a friend)
9. result (with treasure overcome crisis and achieve goal for the video)
10. **BACK TO ORDINARY** return (after crazy adventure, return to the ordinary world)
11. new life (new perspective)
12. resolution


SHORTS

shorts 70% view vs swipe away ratio 
50-59 seconds
i did xyz -> you should know about this
use the word you

20-40% of time on first two lines, third line include a curiosity loops (not for the reasons you might think ...)


short hook -> concise, less than 3 seconds, VERY visually pleasing (watch the video on mute and undestand what its about | so good you can use it as a thumbnail on long form video | no more than 3 objects), foreshadowing (stops your scroll & ensures you get to the end of the video), foreshadow what to expect at the end

example -> here are 3 reasons why X

STORY TELLING
- but so story telling
    - set up conflict
    - resolve the conflict
    - set up new conflict
    - "i was at home, but i got bored, so i went for a walk, but it started raining

- dual narrative story telling
    - one story in voice over
    - another story in visuals/what im showing


Structure and pacing
- quick hook, medium paced middle, peak in middle (funny joke), middle pacing, quick ending
- peak and theory
    - people only remember favorite part and ending of a movie for example
- dont talk fast, talk more concise
    - message across in least words possible
    - concise quick action packed value and context

FORMULA 

Step 1 - TITLES

1. is it a SAQ (clickbait video) or FAQ (title it by the question)
2. Casing by professionalism
3. Uppercase key word
4. Less than 50 characters

Step 2 - VIDEO

1. Is my video education, inspiration or entertaining?
2. Why would my target audience want to watch this video?
    - try to make these as visceral as possible
    - live the experience that they want and really try to feeeeel them
3. What do they want from the video?
4. (Optional) why should they watch my video?

Step 3 - HOOK

1. First 3-8 seconds
    - Hook + meet expectation of viewer
    - Hook satisfies the why from above
2. Foreshadow
    - How is the video going to deliver what they want from the video (chapters, steps, guide, tutorials, information, understanding, frameworks, lessons ...)
    - so that by the end... (deliver what they want)
3. why they should watch your video (could be anything - education (i am credible i have lived experience with their problem and solution))



PLAYLISTS X RELEVANT VIDEO INTROS




GENERAL INTRODUCTION AFTER HOOK
whats good team and welcome to todays xxxx tutorial. my names james and here on the channel i make the cleanest learn to code video every week to help you land a software developer job. If that sounds interesting to you, then smash the subscribe buttons and let's dive into the video.


IF PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED, MAKE THEM interested (FAQ VS SAQ - FAQ IS LABELLED SO PEOPLE SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE, SAQ IS LABELLED TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO SEE)
eg.
How To Get Analytics For Your Website (for free)
-- becomes --
One trick for 247% better websites

Made the same mistake on the markdown video




THE PROCESS

2. Hook the video and meet the expectation of the title

Learn x in y
    - let them know that i'm trusted

    - let them know that i'll make the process easy and accessible for anyone
        - Show them the project
        - Tell them the curriculum

Tech talks
    - SAQ vs FAQ (for title and premise)
    - Say how I did something (gives the credibility)
    - Show don't tell (demonstration / walk through notes / powerpoint)
    - Take advantage of the fact that I did it
    - Tell the story (foreshadow & curiosity loops)

Project / process Videos
    - Show them the finished project (all of it, get them excited)
    - Tell them anyone can do it
    - Ill walk them through every step of the way, and explain everything we do so that you understand the project, and can modify it and feel confident making your own
